#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Building softwares and maintaining softwares , by use of code. These softwares can be games , websites and Apps.
It helps in business efficiency , for example - many businesses do their businesses online and having sth like an app or a website online makes things easier for them and their customers.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
There was first the development of SWE languages (starting with Assembly Language) ,  The SWE as a discipline was established in the â€˜60s and then also the rise of Agile technologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - get the requirements you need from client about the project
Design - Make some designs of possible solutions on design webs like figma (You can even draw them)
Execution - Write code to write solution
Testing - To prospective users to see how well they like the product (or for bugs)
Maintenance - with changing technologies , you can adapt to them.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall it's mostly top down or sth , where we start with the phases in order , and we have to complete each phase before going to the next. However in Agile , we are adapting to any changes that we may encounter along the way - let's say during the design phase perhaps the client wants to add some requirements , so we would have to temporarily go back to the requirements phase to make these changes before continuing again.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
PM - oversees the planning , and execution of the SWE design process.
UI/UX designer - make sketches /designs of apps
Quality Assurance Engineer - oversee the testing of Apps

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - include VS code as its most popular and this is where the code is compiled
VCs - most common is github and this is where the entire history of the code is kept and where engineers 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 	(Adapted from the slideshow)
 - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
System Testing - this is testing the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance testing - To test whether the system/app is accepted by users and see if it meets their needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of creating instructions for AI models to produce specific outputs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Write code that picks a random number.
Improved: Write a code in C++ that demonstrates picking  a random  WHOLE number from 1- 100.
Improvements came with specificity , specific type of input should be a whole number ,and the code should be specifically in C++.
